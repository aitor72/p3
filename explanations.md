# Problems vs. Algorithms

Hello, my name is Aitor Rodriguez and in this file i'm going to explain the algorithms I used to solve each problem. Let's go!

## Problem 1
Time complexity is O(log n) due to tha fact that in the  worst case we search through half of half of an array.


## Problem 2


## Problem 3
| Time Complexity      | The time complexity is `O(n log(n))`.                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explanation | Our functions gets as the input an array of numbers and returns the tupple of the max sums. |


## Problem 4


## Problem 5
To solve this problem i use  a Trie with DFS In-order search. 
The time complexity for insert and find is O(n).

Time complexity for suffixes is O(V + E) where V is the vertices and E is the edges. 



## Problem 6


## Problem 7
| Time Complexity      | The time complexity is `O(1)`.                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Space Complexity** | The space complexity is `O(1)`. No extra space is required to use this algorithm. |

We solve this problem using a Trie and node as is asked in the sample code of the problem. The handler splits the path to insert a new node which can then be traversed for the lookup.
